<h1>FlashFoods</h1>
 <p>Personal project based on (https://github.com/krschan/flashfoods) , a transversal project made in several modules like Markup Language, Development Environments, Database, etc.   

As I said before, this is my way of making the page in parallel with the group work (https://github.com/krschan/flashfoods) , creating and learning my way of coding from scratch my own structure and design. 
The site is based on a platform that through your location detects the best deals and discounts on fast food restaurants near you.  

The goal of this project is to learn new technologies that I can implement in the project. At the moment I'm playing with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and mySQL. As I learn new things I will implement them.
